Copy the relative (to project file's location) path to current file

Usage:
  `cmd+\ or right click`

This differs from https://github.com/bpicolo/CopyRelativePath, in that it uses the project file's path. Thus, if your project file includes "src" and "test", a generated relative path will look like "src/foo/bar" (instead of just "foo/bar" which is what a path relative to open folders would generate).
